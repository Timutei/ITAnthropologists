Enterprise Architecture is a complex abstraction. It’s not easy to define or explain.

Ironically explanation is at the heart of its function. Its purpose is to holistically shine light on how enterprises work and then use that information to guide decision making.

However a poorly understood function emanating from information technology purporting to have the ability to guide business decisions may not be well received.

Enterprises often lose touch with how or why they do what they do. The more humans involved the wider the diversity of activity. The longer an organisation exists the more IT detritus (sorry systems and processes) gathers.

Enterprise Architecture exists to ensure that there is an overall understanding of that complexity. The ‘Why’ of IT.

Solutions Architecture is much easier to understand. 

We have a problem. How do we solve it ? 

Usually confined to ‘How do we solve it technically?’. 

Or more likely ‘I have a hammer, what was your problem again ?’
