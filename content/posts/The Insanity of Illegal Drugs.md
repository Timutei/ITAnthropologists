Historically societies have not fared well banning things. The cost of illegal drugs financially and to the well being of New Zealand is immense.

Our drug problem is growing, crime and gangs are increasing, people do not feel safe. Narcotics are growing more lethal (fentanyl). 

Countries expend a lot of money playing whack a mole. High scores are achieved with no beneficial outcomes.

Experiments with decriminalisation have not worked, especially those not backed with health services. Addictive substances that hook users for life are not a good idea. 

Harmful substances need regulation and controlled distribution. 

So it makes you wonder what the solution to this impass is.Something needs to be done.

Perhaps rethinking things from a consumer perspective might help. There is an obvious demand for illicit highs. Without customers there would be no drug trade. And drug users are no different to normal customers in that they would prefer quality products that are safe. And they would prefer to be in control. 

It's not as if the world hasn't had experience of managing in-demand but harmful substances before. Alcohol for example. 

So instead of banning non-alcoholic highs or decrimilaising hard drugs, why don't governments explore addressing the demand? 

**This could be done by tasking pharmaceutical companies with finding a safe non-addictive high.**

Given recent research findings into the benefits of [Psychedelic/Hallucinogens](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/6734-hallucinogens-lsd-peyote-psilocybin-and-pcp)  for mental health, a [serendipitous outcome](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/06/psychedelics-as-medicine) might be possible.

Of course there will be risks in this approach, but as with alcohol they can be managed through education and regulation. The current situation is not tenable.

And there is the side benefit of moving illegal highs from being a cost to society to one that benefits society.
