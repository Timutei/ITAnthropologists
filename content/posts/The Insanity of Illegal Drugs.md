## Overview

Historically societies have not fared well banning things. The cost of illegal drugs financially and to the well being of New Zealand is immense.

Our drug problem is growing, crime and gangs are increasing, people do not feel safe. Narcotics are growing more lethal (fentanyl). Countries expend a lot of money playing whack a mole. High scores are achieved with no beneficial outcomes.

Experiments with decriminalisation have not worked, especially those not backed with health services. Harmful substances need regulation and controlled distribution. 

Societal views are entrenched and increasingly partisan.
