## Introduction
I’ve had the privilege of working for many different managers, men and women. Good people all of them.

Watching them in my early days hardened my resolve to not be a manager. Managing people I viewed as difficult. Besides technology was much more interesting and easier to control.

Unfortunately as I learned and achieved more, the powers-that-be decided I should take on managerial responsibility. They of course did this with minimal training. HR in the 80s and 90s was about entry-to and exit-from the organisation, remuneration, payroll and perks. 

As I was forced to deal with people both above and below I started to try and categorise them. For those that worked for me I was highly selective with technical competence being prime. For those I worked for it was a matter of keeping them fed, enjoying our successes without too many issues. 

It was during this gestation I coined the term ‘Reasonable Man’.

This arose from an incident where I and my partner-in-crime were working on establishing a messaging hub in HongKong. (This was in the days before email protocols standardised)

This was the age where telecommunications companies owned the golden goose. Monopolies that printed money on the back of voice minutes. To meet targets, product managers reduced per minute charges thereby increasing volume driving revenue and profit (people back then loved to talk to each other, a reducing trend nowadays)

So the product manager weren’t keen on this messaging hub concept. It was small potatoes (millions in revenue) versus voice (hundreds of millions).

But we persisted, working with Schlumberger targeting the Oil and Gas industry who desperately needed electronic communications with their customer and partner base. (Not to mention they worked in locations with low bandwidth so text-based communication was preferable and less expensive than international calls, another reason voice product managers were leery)

After a successful customer trial, my boss called me in to discuss going ahead. 

He sat me down, congratulated me on the trial and then very nicely gave me the bad news.

‘I am afraid we can’t go ahead as there is no budget’ he said, with the product manager smiling on the side. 

“That is puzzling” I responded, as we budgeted for this at the beginning of the year. “It’s in my budget” I pointed out fortunately having a printout on hand. 

This caused a moment of consternation with a sharp intake of breath, especially to the side of the room. 

I was ushered from the room being told ‘We will get back to you’

A couple of weeks later, I was called back. “We have decided to go ahead” my boss announced supported by a smiled grimace from the product manager. “But” he paused. “We won’t be able to use your budget”.

Puzzled I asked why. 

“I am afraid that they would not believe us” he said, implying that planning to do something and succeeding was not common. “We will find the budget elsewhere”

Hence the term **Reasonable Man**.

As I grew older and was given more managerial responsibility I realised that at some stage in our careers we all become ‘Reasonable Men’
