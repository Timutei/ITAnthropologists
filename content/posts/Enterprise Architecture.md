## Introduction

Enterprise Architecture is a complex abstraction. It’s not easy to define or explain.

Ironically explanation is at the heart of its function. Its purpose is to holistically shine light on how enterprises work and use that information to guide decision making.

However a poorly understood function emanating from information technology purporting to have the ability to guide business decisions may not be well received.

Solutions Architecture is much easier to understand. We have a problem. How do we solve it ? Usually confined to ‘How do we solve it technically?’
