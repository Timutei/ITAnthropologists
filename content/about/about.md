I've spent some forty years surfing technology. I've been fortunate having a wide and varied career and its about time I gave something back.

Why the name ITAnthropologists? 

Apart from the need to apologise for the impact of IT on humanity, I believe that people are an essential component of any solution path and are often overlooked.

Technology can only do so much. It's an enabler. How it is used and misused is down to the humans involved.

Hence the composite 'ITAnthropologist'. If you remove 'nthro' it may raise a smile.

I've long been a blog/social media sceptic (Twitter is for twits, X is for super twits...), so this will be a work in progress.

Hope you enjoy.
