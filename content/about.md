I've spent some forty years surfing technology. I've been fortunate
having a wide and varied career and its about time I gave something
back.

Why the name ITAnthropologists ? 

Apart from the need to apologise for the impact of IT on humanity (ITApologist),
I believe that people are an essential component of any solution path 
that is often overlooked

Technology can only do so much. It's an enabler. How it is used and
misused is down to the humans involved. (Linking in Anthro)

I've long been a blog/social media sceptic, so this will be a work in progress.

Hope you enjoy.
