I've spent some forty years surfing technology. I've been fortunate
having a wide and varied career and its about time I gave something
back.

Why the name ITAnthropologists ? 

Apart from the need to apologise for the impact of IT on humanity,
I believe that people are an essential component of any solution path 
that is often overlooked

Technology can only do so much. It's an enabler. How it is used and
misused is down to the humans involved.

IT also suffers awful communication mismatches with folk struggling to
comprehend the (often multi-million) decisions forced upon them.

So I will try and raise a smile while observing some of my journy's 
learnings.

Hope you enjoy.
Tim
